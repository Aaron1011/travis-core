class Request

  # A Request goes through the following lifecycle:
  #
  #  * A newly created instance is in the `created` state.
  #  * Its `start` and `configure` events are triggered by the request's
  #    configure job. The `configure` event then triggers the `finish` event
  #    TODO: why is that? why not rename `configure` to `finish`?
  #
  # Once configured a Request will be approved if the given branch is included
  # and not excluded and the repository is not a Rails fork.
  #
  # When the Request is approved then it creates a Build.
  # TODO: why does creating the Build not happen on `finish`?
