    # A Job::Configure goes through the following lifecycle:
    #
    #  * A newly created instance is in the `created` state.
    #  * When started it propagates the event to the Request it belongs to.
    #  * When finished it sets the configuration to the Request.
    #  * After both `start` and `finish` events listeners will be notified.
