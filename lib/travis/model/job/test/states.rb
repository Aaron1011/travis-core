    # A Job::Test goes through the following lifecycle:
    #
    #  * A newly created instance is in the `created` state.
    #  * When started it sets attributes from the payload and clears its log
    #    (relevant for re-started jobs).
    #  * When finished it sets attributes from the payload and adds tags.
    #  * On both events it notifies event handlers and then propagates the even
    #    to the build it belongs to.
    #  * It also notifies event handlers of the `log` event whenever something
    #    is appended to the log.
